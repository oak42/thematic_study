端口/接口

In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices. 
In computer terms, a port generally refers to the part of a computing device available for connection to peripherals such as input and output devices. 
Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. 
On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects. 
Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices.

## [Port (computer networking)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) ##
In computer networking, a port is an endpoint of communication. 
Physical as well as wireless connections are terminated at ports of hardware devices. 
At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. 
Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. 
Inbound packets are received, and the port number in the header is used to decide which application is to be passed the packets.

通信端口（英语：port），又称为连接端口、端口、协议端口（protocol port）在计算机网络中是一种经由软件创建的服务，在一个计算机操作系统中扮演通信的端点（endpoint）。
每个通信端口都会与主机的IP地址及通信协议关联。通信端口以16比特数字来表示，这被称为通信端口编号（port number）。

位于传输层的通信协议通常需要指定端口号，例如在TCP/IP协议族之下的TCP与UDP协议。
在应用层中，使用主从式架构的通信协议，在每个通信端口上提供多路复用服务（multiplexing service）。
经由公认通信端口号（well-known port numbers），通常可以辨认出这个连线使用的通信协议，
其中具代表性的是最基础的1024个公认通信端口号（well-known port numbers），例如telnet协议默认使用23端口来连线，HTTP连线默认使用80端口。

The well-known ports (also known as system ports) are those from 0 through 1023. The requirements for new assignments in this range are stricter than for other registrations,[2] examples include:

● 20: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer

● 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control

● 22: Secure Shell (SSH) Secure Login

● 23: Telnet remote login service, unencrypted text messages

● 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) E-mail routing

● 53: Domain Name System (DNS) service

● 80: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the World Wide Web

● 110: Post Office Protocol (POP3)

● 119: Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)

● 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP)

● 143: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Management of digital mail

● 161: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

● 194: Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

● 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL

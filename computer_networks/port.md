In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices. In computer terms, a port generally refers to the part of a computing device available for connection to peripherals such as input and output devices. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of equipment to which a plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several conductors where the port and cable contacts connect, provide a method to transfer signals between devices.

## [Port (computer networking)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) ##
In computer networking, a port is an endpoint of communication. Physical as well as wireless connections are terminated at ports of hardware devices. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the port number. Inbound packets are received, and the port number in the header is used to decide which application is to be passed the packets.

The well-known ports (also known as system ports) are those from 0 through 1023. The requirements for new assignments in this range are stricter than for other registrations,[2] examples include:

● 20: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer

● 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control

● 22: Secure Shell (SSH) Secure Login

● 23: Telnet remote login service, unencrypted text messages

● 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) E-mail routing

● 53: Domain Name System (DNS) service

● 80: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the World Wide Web

● 110: Post Office Protocol (POP3)

● 119: Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)

● 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP)

● 143: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Management of digital mail

● 161: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

● 194: Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

● 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL
